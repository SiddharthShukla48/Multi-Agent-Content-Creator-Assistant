This research document has provided comprehensive information on AI ethics, including key facts and statistics, different perspectives, recent developments, expert opinions, and interesting examples. As AI continues to evolve and become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to prioritize AI ethics and develop frameworks and guidelines that ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI.\n\n**References**\n\nAI Now Institute.
