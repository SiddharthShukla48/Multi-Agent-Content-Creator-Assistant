The demand for XAI is increasing, driven by regulatory requirements, technological advances, and business needs. Various techniques, frameworks, and tools have been developed to support XAI, and expert opinions emphasize the importance of XAI in various applications. Interesting examples and case studies demonstrate the potential of XAI in healthcare, finance, education, and other industries.\n\nReferences:\n\nAccenture. (2020).
